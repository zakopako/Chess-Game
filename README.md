# Chess-Game
The game of chess created in python, using pygame as a GUI

I wanted to create this game in order to start getting the gears grinding as I have not used python in a while, and wanted to make something in order to prove to myself I can code in python and make something out of it. Python is a very popular and in demand programming language, so I also thought it would be a good idea to display my skills here. I havent used OOP in python before, so this was a good way to try it out.

I have completed the base game and it runs in idle. I am going to take it to the next step and bring it in a GUI using pygame.

Implemented character models and puts them in the correct position.
